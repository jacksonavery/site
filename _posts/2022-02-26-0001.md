###### Watching the anime <span class="smallcaps">Heike Monogatari</span> recently, I've been wanting to talk a bit about the second episode. This post will spoil parts of <span class="smallcaps">Heike Monogatari</span>, both the anime and the epic. Long story short, I recommend the show, although a lot of it won't make complete sense without knowledge of the original story. I've run into it myself. Lots of cuts to unexplained things happening.

---

## Background

I know we all love it when the anime writer infodumps right at the beginning, but it's a dense adaptation of a dense epic, so forgive me. I'm trying to keep it short.

### Original Epic

Tokuko marriage 415gurai ???

Giou was a [shirabyoushi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraby%C5%8Dshi)[^roomaji] who was outperformed by Hotoke. To quote the above page directly (as of 2022/02/26):

>The story of Giō and Hotoke, featured in the Heike Monogatari, tells of the most famous shirabyōshi, Giō, who had won the heart of Taira no Kiyomori, being ousted by a younger and more talented shirabyōshi named Hotoke. Kiyomori cruelly sent Giō away, which grieved her greatly, and Hotoke was constantly ridden with guilt. A year later, Giō was asked to perform a dance for Hotoke at Kiyomori's command, who actually intended on humiliating her. In her grief and humiliation, Giō, her sister and their mother became nuns seeking for a happier life. A few years later, the guilt was too great for Hotoke and she too became a nun. She asked for forgiveness from Giō, who willingly forgave her and the four women lived out the rest of their days in prayer.


### Anime

Biwa is an orphan girl adopted into a Heike royal court by Shigemori, a man indirectly responsible for her father's death. They both possess the ability to see the future by covering one of their heterochromatic eyes. Unfortunately, their futures tend to consist of people they love dying.

## The Episode

Now I'd like to introduce a few scenes showcasing thematic elements from the episode. I don't want to talk too much about the original story because I imagine it's been beaten to death, so I'll be focusing on the content novel to the anime.[^horse] In particular I want to discuss major repeated terms.

### Terms - 先と闇

The first two major repeated terms in the episode are 先,&nbsp;"the future," and 闇,&nbsp;"darkness."

#### Scene - [一寸先は闇:no one knows the future]

![一寸先は闇](/assets/heikemonogatari02/一寸先は闇.jpg)

Shigemori is seeing ???, and is accompanied by Biwa.

Biwa, annoyed by ???'s actions, quotes this idiom at him. It's not made clear whether or not ??? understands Biwa and Shigemori's heterochromatic prophecy, but the point remains that ??? does not seem to take human life into account as much as he should.

While I translate the idiom "一寸先は闇" as above, a more literal gloss would be "even a moment ahead is shrouded in dark."[^dark] There's an irony to this; when Biwa says that the future is shrouded in dark, she means that the future is uncertain. And yet, when Shigemori looks to the dark, all he can see is the death that he knows to be certain. To him, the problem is not 一寸先は闇, that the moment ahead is the darkness of the unknown. It's that 闇は一寸先, that the moment ahead is the darkness of certainty.[^inversion]

#### Scene - [先が恐ろしい:the future scares me]

![先が恐ろしい](/assets/heikemonogatari02/先が恐ろしい.jpg)

Biwa is playing outside, and Shigemori comes out. First he states his own fear of the dark, calling back to the section above. Then he asks if Biwa has any fears. She responds simply:

|Biwa|わしは、先が恐ろしい。|
||The future scares me.|

Thus, Shigemori, wisened by exposure to the same heterochromatic prophecy, delivers the episode's primary idea:

|Shigemori|闇も先も恐ろしくとも、今この時は美しいのう。|
||No matter how terrible the darkness or the future may be, right now is beautiful.|

What makes this line so striking is its applicabilty to both interpretations of darkness. Shigemori and Biwa must focus on the present because they understand how terrible the future will be. But to everyone else, and to the average person, you must focus on the present instead of how terrible the future may be. In both cases, the best course is to focus on what you have now. At the end of the day, it's a rather straightforward message, but the build into and around it makes it much more powerful.

Besides, at this point we're only halfway through the episode, and there's plenty of runtime left to qualify the statement.

### Term - また今度

The other regularly repeated term is また今度, "another time."[^translationhard]

#### Scene - [いい言葉:great terms]

![いい言葉](/assets/heikemonogatari02/いい言葉.jpg)

This conversation is held between Biwa, Tokuko, and Giou. They're discussing a woman with a similar heterochromia to Biwa, who may be her lost mother.

|Giou|いつか、きっと会えるわよ。|
||Some day, I'm sure you'll meet her.|
|Biwa|「いつか」と言うのはいい言葉だな。明日、明後日、先のことが少し楽しみになるの。|
||"Some day" is a great term, huh. Tomorrow, the day, after, it makes it all seem a little more enjoyable.|
|Giou|では、私は仏御前様のお相手をしに行くわね。|
||Anyways, I must ???meet with Hotoke.|
|Biwa|祇王、また今度舞を見せて。|
||Giou, let me see you dance another time (in the future).|
|Giou|「また今度」もいい言葉ね。|
||"Another time" is another great term, isn't it.|

???

#### Scene - [出家:nunhood]

![出家](/assets/heikemonogatari02/出家.jpg)

Giou explains that Hotoke has replaced her as a dancer. She apologizes to Biwa:

|Giou|また今度が果たせなくてごめんなさい。|
||I'm sorry that there won't be another time.|

making it clear that she'll never dance again. 

Later, Hotoke appears at the shrine, where she is accepted by Giou. While nothing is stated as explicitly as in the original, no contradictions are made, so it's reasonable to assume similar events occured in the anime's retelling.

#### Scene - [入内:betrothal]

![入内](/assets/heikemonogatari02/入内.jpg)

Afterwards, Tokuko is ???, and must part with Biwa. ???(where's she going? the water palace right?) Biwa is understandably unenthusiastic because she has been having visions of Tokuko drowning.

|Tokuko|これからだって 会えなくなるわけじゃない。また今度、ね？|
||It's not like we'll never be able to meet again. Another time, right?|

???

## Closing Thoughts

## Afterthoughts

I really like what I've seen so far of the anime but in writing this I've realized how much of it goes over my head becuase of my lack of context and my insitence on only ever watching anime jsubbed. I'm considering reading a translation of Heike Monogatari before coming back to the show because I think it'll really enhance my enjoyment. I gather that it's absurdly long, but I guess we'll see.

Either way I would absolutely recommend the show. Probably better to watch it <span class="smallcaps">en</span>-subbed though, unless you have the context or the fluency to meet the show's.

---

## Zoku Afterthoughts 

I'm a little worried about putting this out because there's a definite possibility that a learned Heike Monogatari reader points something obvious out and I'll look a fool. By all means, point it out, I'll edit it and credit you, I just figure it's worth stating that I'm not an expert here, just trying to talk about a show I like.

Another thing I should get out is that I do all the translations myself, so if they vary from any offical translations, know that mine are correct. But seriously, translation is complicated, particularly translation for the sake of analysis. I'm trying to make these seem like sentences people would actually say, while also highlighting metaphorical language in two different languages. I imagine any offical translations would be more idiomatic, but mine serve my purposes.

Finally, I'm still figuring out formatting, particularly where I'm trying to provide both <span class="smallcaps">jp</span> and <span class="smallcaps">en</span> text. I'm actually pretty fond of entabling it, but it is not without negatives.

For design in general I don't plan on anything hyper-complicated à la [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/Design) but I still acknowledge room for improvement.

With all that said, thanks for reading this through! また今度、ね？

### Footnotes

[^roomaji]: I'm not finalized on how I'll romanize yet. Here, I've compromised by following no-one's convention.

[^horse]: Which has been only mildly beaten to death.

[^dark]: As much as I love abusing furigana[^recursivefootnotelol], "[一寸先は闇:even a moment ahead is shrouded in dark]" is too much.

[^inversion]: To be clear Japanese does not systematically derive meaning from word order, but I find the inversion makes sense in this context.

[^translationhard]: I honestly don't love this translation but I've looked around and I can't find/think of a better one. It's pretty accurate in my opinion, it's just awkward to throw around in English. It's used on multiple occasions, and either way I care about the specific phrase, so I can't really write around it either. If you're an English speaker just imagine that "another time" is a normal thing to say casually.

[^recursivefootnotelol]: まあ、振りしないと仮名じゃない。訳ロ字？ウイキペディアには「ルビ」と言う人があると書いてあるけど英語で普通にそう言わないと思います。日本語が話せない人が気にならないために日本語で書きますけど。
