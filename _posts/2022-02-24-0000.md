# [七百万へようこそ！:welcome to nanahyakuman!]
This site was created without salient long term goals beyond "I want to practice writing more."[^5] 

I like mixing Japanese and English but I'm going to try to make everything important fully comprehensible to someone with no jp. I'm also a big footnotes guy.[^8]

I'm not a huge fan of long introductions on blogs, particulary when they make promises that the site doesn't keep up with, so I'll do a short [自己紹介:self intro] and be on my way.

I'm a CS major, and a self-student of Japanese.[^1] I recently started a jp minor at uni.[^2] I'm graduating soon™. I'm generally interested in game design and most arts, and I make electronic music. これからよろしくね。

[^1]: Doing a lazy version of AJATT (or whatever we call it nowadays).
[^2]: I'm not sold on traditional classes being terribly effective in the ways they say they are. However, there are benefits.
[^5]: And that I want to mess around with markdown.
