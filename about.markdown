fl musician, cs student, jp learner.

#### This site:

The primary Latin character set font for this site is CharisSIL, available under the [SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1](../assets/fonts/Charis-OFL-License.txt). The primary CJK font is [アプリ明朝:AppliMincho], also available under the [SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1](../assets/fonts/アプリ明朝_LICENSE_OFL.txt). It's a derivative of Adobe Source Han Serif with some small changes that I think make it marginally more legible as a web font, although I'm still looking for one that fits a little better. I don't love relying on two seperate fonts but it looks best this way.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) themed with a modified version of [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), and the gem [Jekyll Furigana](https://github.com/guentoan/jekyll-furigana), all available under the standard [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
